# Fun_w_Topic_Modeling

This repo contains sample code for a Scrapy spider for scraping Wired's business section archives as well as code for the HDP-LDA model used for topic modeling of those articles.

The data were stored as JSON and contains:
* **23,918 articles** written at a college-grad reading level 
* **17,918,810 words** averaging 6 characters each 

It would take a human reader **89,594 minutes** (over 2 months) to read everything at an average reading rate.

The presentation file is the presentation that was used to communicate highlights from these findings that reveal a trend towards celebrity culture in politics as well as its growing incluence over the private sector in the US.
